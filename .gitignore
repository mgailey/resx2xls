# READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE!
#
# If you are about to add an ignore that only affects one specific
# project please add it to the .gitignore file that is located in
# that projects directory; eg. src/Web.Whatever/.gitignore
#
# If the file doesn't exist, add it.
#
# If the ignore is on another level then for a certain project I
# trust you'll make the proper judgement and place it properly.
#
# The purpose of keeping the ignores as close to the physical location
# as possible is to simplify the maintenance of the files themselves.
# If a directory is removed all ignores that are specific to it will
# be removed as well without having to remember to edit this file.
